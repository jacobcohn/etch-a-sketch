I am creating an Etch-a-Sketch. 
Here we go!

I just finished creating everything for this project.
I learned a ton thrughout this project and I am glad
that it over. Even though the project looks good, I 
know that my code isn't perfect. I can't wait to look
back in a couple years at this project (my first 
complete project) and look at my code and the mistakes
that I made. THANK YOU!
